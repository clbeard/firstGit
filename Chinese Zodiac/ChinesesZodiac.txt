The chinese zodiac hs been around since the 5th century B.C..The zodiac is  an easy way to determine someones birth year using animals 
.The chinese zodiac is composed of animals that span sixty years with each animal signifying a different year. It is beleived that the chinese
zodiac system is based off of the Chinese lunar calendar which was invented by emperor Huangdi in 2637 B.C..This calendar follows the different 
cycles of the moon which can be used to count years, months,days , and hours.

The chinese zodiac is typically composed of 12 animals beginning with the rat. According to their beliefs 
These animals come from different earthly branches based off of the animals characteristics. Each person can be multiple
animals rather than just one. Someone could be appear,internally,truly, and secretively be all different types of animals.
This is usually caused by conflict with how one lives and their zodiac sign which is called "Tai Sui".

The calendar is also based of of the four pillars. With each pillar signifying year,month,day, and hour of birth . This serves as this basic 
for the zodiac calendar and is also part of many different cultures across the world. From the chinese zodiac came the Japanese,Korean , and the Vietnamese
zodiac. Each of these borrowed aspects of the chinese zodiac and many of them still exists today.
