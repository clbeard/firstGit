there are many languages currently being used for web programmers but one stands out above them all
. Not only in performance but popularity as well. PHP is one of the fastest languages available and is 
also open source.PHPs benefits that allow it to stand out among other languages are facts like
PHP works very well with databases . This fact along with the speed and price it is pretty much a no brainer
as to why PHP is one of the highest-rated tools in the Web Developers toolkit.
